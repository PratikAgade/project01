## Data Flow

1. User adds transactions through the TransactionForm component
2. Transactions are stored in the App component's state and persisted in localStorage
3. Dashboard component calculates and displays summaries based on these transactions
4. TransactionList component displays, filters, and allows deletion of transactions
5. Calculator component provides a simple calculator functionality independent of transaction data

## State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management:
- `transactions` state in App.js is the single source of truth for all transaction data
- Component-specific state (like form inputs or active filters) is managed locally in each component
- localStorage is used for data persistence across browser sessions

## Styling

The application uses custom CSS with:
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop layouts
- Card-based UI components
- Color-coding for different transaction types
