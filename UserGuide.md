# Budget Calculator User Guide

Welcome to the Budget Calculator app! This guide will help you understand how to use all the features of this application to manage your personal finances.

## Getting Started

The Budget Calculator is designed to help you track four types of financial transactions:
- **Expenses**: Money you spend
- **Income**: Money you earn
- **Borrowed**: Money you borrow from others
- **Lent**: Money you lend to others

## Navigation

The app has two main tabs:
1. **Dashboard**: Shows your financial summary and includes a calculator
2. **Transactions**: Allows you to add new transactions and view your transaction history

You can switch between these tabs by clicking on the tab names at the top of the app.

## Adding Transactions

To add a new transaction:

1. Go to the **Transactions** tab
2. Select the transaction type (Expense, Income, Borrowed, or Lent)
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Amount**: Enter the amount in Rupees (₹)
   - **Description**: A brief description of the transaction
   - **Category**: Select from the predefined categories
   - **Contact Name**: Required for Borrowed/Lent transactions only
   - **Notes** (Optional): Any additional information

4. Click the "Add Transaction" button to save the transaction

### Transaction Types Explained

- **Expense**: Any money you spend (e.g., groceries, rent, bills)
- **Income**: Any money you earn (e.g., salary, freelance work, gifts)
- **Borrowed**: Money you receive from someone with the intention to pay back
- **Lent**: Money you give to someone who will pay you back later

## Viewing Your Financial Summary

The Dashboard provides an overview of your finances:

- **Income Total**: Total of all income transactions
- **Expenses Total**: Total of all expense transactions
- **Borrowed Total**: Total amount you have borrowed
- **Lent Total**: Total amount you have lent
- **Balance**: Your current balance (Income + Borrowed - Expenses - Lent)

The Dashboard also shows your most recent transactions for quick reference.

## Managing Transactions

In the Transactions tab, you can:

1. **View All Transactions**: See all your transactions sorted by date (newest first)
2. **Filter Transactions**: Use the filter options to view only specific transaction types
3. **Delete Transactions**: Remove unwanted transactions by clicking the trash icon

## Using the Calculator

The Budget Calculator includes a simple calculator that can help you with basic arithmetic operations:

1. **Input Numbers**: Click the number buttons (0-9) to enter values
2. **Operations**: Use the +, -, ×, and / buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
3. **Clear**: Press the "C" button to clear all values
4. **Calculate**: Press the "=" button to perform the calculation

The calculator displays both the regular number result and the equivalent amount in Indian Rupees (₹).

## Data Storage

All your transaction data is stored locally on your device, so:

- Your data remains private and never leaves your device
- You can use the app offline
- Your data will persist even if you close the browser
- Clearing your browser data will erase all stored transactions

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Regular Updates**: Add transactions as they occur for the most accurate financial picture
- **Consistent Categorization**: Use consistent categories to better track spending patterns
- **Transaction Descriptions**: Write clear descriptions to help remember transaction details
- **Contact Names**: For borrowed/lent money, always record the person's name
- **Notes**: Use the notes field to add context or reminders about the transaction

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **Missing Transactions**: Check if you've activated a filter that might be hiding certain transactions
- **Incorrect Balance**: Verify that you've categorized your transactions correctly (income vs. expense, etc.)
- **Data Loss**: If your transactions disappear, your browser's localStorage may have been cleared

We hope this guide helps you make the most of your Budget Calculator app! Happy budgeting!
